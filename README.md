# CCP-INT-problems-instances
This repository contains the benchmark of tests instances used in “A solution algorithm for chance-constrained problems with integer second-stage recourse decisions” (A. Lodi, E. Malaguti, M. Monaci, G. Nannicini and P. Paronuzzi)

Each file is structured as follows.
- Line 1: number of resources;
- Line 2: number of customer types;
- Line 4: vector of resources costs;
- Lines 6-25: matrix of service rates;
- Lines 27-226: demands of each scenario (each line corresponds to a different scenario).

For additional details on how define an instance of a Chance Constraint Program with integer scenario variables, we refer the reader to the aforementioned paper.
